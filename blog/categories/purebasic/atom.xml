    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many times, during my work, I need to type or paste the path of a folder or file. On Windows 7 if you &ldquo;Shift + Right-Click&rdquo; on a file or folder, you get the &ldquo;Copy as path&rdquo; option, which copies to the clipboard the complete path of the folder or file. The path is copied surrounded by double quotes. Windows XP (yes, I still use Windows XP, mostly for testing) does not have &ldquo;Copy as path&rdquo;, also on Windows 7 many times I need the path without the double quotes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to write my own small program to add &ldquo;Copy as path&rdquo; options to Windows XP and also use it on Windows 7 to get just the path, no double quotes.</p>

<h2>CopyPath written in PureBasic</h2>

<p>PureBasic is a native 32-bit and 64-bit programming language based on established BASIC rules. The key features of PureBasic are portability (Windows, Linux and MacOS X are currently supported), the production of very fast and highly optimized executables and, of course, the very simple BASIC syntax.</p>
